# Intro to Python Coursework

This repository contains code written as part of my **Introduction to Python** course at NYU.

The projects in this repo were designed to help build a foundation in Python programming, covering topics like:

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- File I/O
- Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Simple problem-solving and algorithm design

Each script or folder corresponds to a different assignment or learning module from the course.
